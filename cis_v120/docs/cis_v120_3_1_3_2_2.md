## Description

For all the email domains configured in Google Workspace, a corresponding Sender Policy Framework (SPF) record should be created.

**NOTE:**
There are a number of ways SPF can be configured, this document presents a most basic method. For more information on setting up SPF for Google Workspace please refer to the Google documentation.

SPF records allow Gmail and other mail systems to know where messages from your domains are allowed to originate. This information can be used by that system to determine how to treat the message based on if it is being spoofed or is valid.

## Remediation

Configure the DNS record for each domain.

- If all email in your domain is sent from and received by Google Gmail, add the following TXT record for each domain:

```bash
v=spf1 include:_spf.google.com ~all
```

**NOTE:** This will likely need to be configured at your domain registrar (Godaddy, etc.).

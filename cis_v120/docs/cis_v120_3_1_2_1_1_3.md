## Description

You should control sharing of documents to external domains by either blocking domains or only allowing sharing with specific named domains.

Attackers will often attempt to expose sensitive information to external entities through sharing, and restricting the domains that your users can share documents with will reduce that surface area.

## Remediation

To configure this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select `Apps`.
3. Select `Google Workspace`.
4. Select `Drive and Docs`.
5. Under `Sharing settings`, select `Sharing options`.
6. Under `Sharing outside of <Company>`, select `ALLOWLISTED DOMAINS - Files owned by users in <Company> can be shared with Google Accounts in compatible allowlisted domains.`
7. Set `Warn when files owned by users or shared drives in <Company> are shared with users in allowlisted domains` to `checked`.
8. Select `Save`.

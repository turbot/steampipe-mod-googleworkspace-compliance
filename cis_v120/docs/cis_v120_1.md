# Directory

## Overview

This section covers security recommendations for Google Workspace Directory settings. Directory settings control how users are managed and how directory data is shared within and outside your organization.

## Recommendations

### 1.1 Users
Controls in this section focus on user account management, particularly super admin accounts:
- Ensuring appropriate number of super admin accounts
- Restricting super admin account usage
- Managing super admin privileges

### 1.2 Directory Settings
Controls in this section focus on directory data sharing and access:
- Restricting external access to directory data
- Managing directory sharing settings
- Controlling directory visibility

## Implementation

Each control in this section is implemented using SQL queries against the Steampipe Google Workspace plugin tables. The queries check various aspects of directory configuration and return one of the following status values:

- `ok` - The control check passed
- `alarm` - The control check failed
- `info` - The control check found something that should be reviewed
- `skip` - The control check was skipped

## Best Practices

1. **Super Admin Accounts**
   - Maintain at least two super admin accounts
   - Use dedicated accounts for super admin duties
   - Regularly review super admin access

2. **Directory Access**
   - Limit directory visibility to authorized users
   - Restrict external directory sharing
   - Regularly audit directory access settings

3. **User Management**
   - Implement strong user lifecycle management
   - Regularly review user access rights
   - Monitor and audit user activities

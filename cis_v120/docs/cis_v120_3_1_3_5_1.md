## Description

POP and IMAP may allow users to access Gmail using legacy or unapproved email clients that do not support modern authentication mechanisms, such as multifactor authentication.

Disabling POP and IMAP prevents use of legacy and unapproved email clients with weaker authentication mechanisms that would increase the risk of email account credential compromise.

## Remediation

To configure this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select `Apps`.
3. Select `Google Workspace`.
4. Select `Gmail`.
5. Under `End User Access` - `POP and IMAP Access`.
6. Set `Enable IMAP access for all users` to `unchecked`.
7. Set `Enable POP access for all users` to `unchecked`.
8. Select `Save`.

### Default Value

- `Enable IMAP access for all users` is `checked`
- `Enable POP access for all users` is `checked`

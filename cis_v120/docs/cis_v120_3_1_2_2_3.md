## Description

Prevent users to install Google Docs add-ons from add-ons store.

**NOTE:** This setting controls add-on access from outside your organization.

Allowing uses to install unapproved Add-Ons puts the organization at risk. If users need a specific Add-On this can be handled on a case by case basis as the need, and the add-on, is approved.

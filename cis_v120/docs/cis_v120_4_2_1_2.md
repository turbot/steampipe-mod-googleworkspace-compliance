## Description

Weekly review connected applications for potential malicious or unintended access or connections.

Performing a periodic review of connected applications and their permission scopes ensures only permitted and required applications can access organizational data or resources. Attackers commonly attempt to persuade or trick users to grant their application access to organizational data resources by asking for their consent.

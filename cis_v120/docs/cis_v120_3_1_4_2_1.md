## Description

Control how users chat with people outside of your organization. If you allow your users to chat externally, you can also allow them to create and join spaces with people outside your organization.

Restricting external chat to only approved domains potentially limits the spread of company information.

## Remediation

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.

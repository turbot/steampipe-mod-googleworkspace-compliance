## Description

A per-user outbound gateway is a mail server, other than the Google Workspace mail servers, that delivers outgoing mail for a user in your domain.

Mail sent via external SMTP will circumvent your outbound gateway

## Remediation

To configure this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select `Apps`.
3. Select `Google Workspace`.
4. Select `Gmail`.
5. Under `End User Access` - `Allow per-user outbound gateways`, set `Allow users to send mail through an external SMTP server when configuring a "from" address hosted outside your email domain` to `unchecked`.
6. Select `Save`.

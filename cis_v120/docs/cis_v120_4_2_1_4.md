## Description

Weekly review domain-wide delegations for applications for potentially malicious or unintended access or connections.

Domain-wide delegation is a powerful feature that allows apps to access users' data across your organization's entire Workspace account. Performing a periodic review of domain-wide delegations for applications and their permission scopes ensures only permitted and required applications can access organizational data or resources.

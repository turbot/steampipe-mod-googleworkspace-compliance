Details on what each of these fields mean can be found **[here](https://apps.google.com/supportwidget/articlehome?hl=en&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.google.com%2Fa%2Fanswer%2F6000269%3Fhl%3Den&assistant_id=generic-unu&product_context=6000269&product_name=UnuFlow&trigger_context=a)**. This report should be reviewed weekly.

**NOTE:** In larger organizations reviewing this entire report weekly may not be possible. At a minimum, all Administrator and Super Administrator users should be reviewed, since they are a higher risk. These can be filtered from the overall user list.

The Security report provides a comprehensive view of how people share and access data and whether they take appropriate security precautions. For example, you can review who installs external apps, shares numerous files, skips 2-Step Verification, and uses security keys.

## Remediation

The remediation for any anomalies in the various fields varies widely (different sections of the Google Workspace Admin UI). Please refer to Google's documentation for specifics (**[here](https://apps.google.com/supportwidget/articlehome?hl=en&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.google.com%2Fa%2Fanswer%2F6000269%3Fhl%3Den&assistant_id=generic-unu&product_context=6000269&product_name=UnuFlow&trigger_context=a)**).

**NOTE:** Many of these settings will be remedied by implementing other sections of this Benchmark. For example, an Admin not enrolled in 2-Step Verification can be remedied by implementing the Remediation procedure for the recommendation **Ensure 2-Step Verification (Multi-Factor Authentication) is enforced for all users in administrative roles**.

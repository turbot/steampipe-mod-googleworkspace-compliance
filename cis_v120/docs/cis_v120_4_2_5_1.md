## Description

Configure Google cloud session control to strengthen session expiration.

As an administrator, you can control how long different users can access the Google Cloud console and Cloud SDK without having to re-authenticate. For example, you might want users with elevated privileges, like project owners, billing administrators, or others with administrator roles, to re-authenticate more frequently than regular users.​​​​​​ If you set a session length, they’re prompted to sign in again to start a new session.

## Remediation

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.

# 3.1.3.1 Ensure DKIM is enabled for all mail enabled domains

## Description

This control ensures that DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) is enabled for all mail-enabled domains in your Google Workspace organization. DKIM adds a digital signature to outgoing messages that helps verify the authenticity of emails sent from your domain.

## Rationale

DKIM helps prevent email spoofing and phishing attacks by allowing receiving mail servers to verify that emails claiming to be from your domain are legitimate. Without DKIM, attackers could more easily forge emails that appear to come from your domain.

## Impact

- **Security**: High
- **Implementation**: Medium
- **Operational Impact**: Low

## Audit Procedure

1. Sign in to the Google Admin Console
2. Go to Apps > Google Workspace > Gmail > Authenticate email
3. For each mail-enabled domain:
   - Check if DKIM signing is enabled
   - Verify the DKIM key is properly configured
   - Confirm the DNS records are correctly published

## Remediation

To enable DKIM for a domain:

1. Sign in to the Google Admin Console
2. Go to Apps > Google Workspace > Gmail > Authenticate email
3. Select the domain
4. Click "Generate new record"
5. Copy the generated DKIM record
6. Add the DKIM record to your domain's DNS settings
7. Return to the Admin Console and click "Start authentication"

## Default Value

By default, DKIM is not enabled for new domains.

## Note

DKIM should be used in conjunction with SPF and DMARC for comprehensive email authentication. Monitor DKIM key rotation and ensure DNS records are kept up to date.

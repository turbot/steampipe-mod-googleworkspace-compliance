## Description

Configure Google Workspace's session control to strengthen session expiration.

As an administrator, you can control how long users can access Google services, such as Gmail on the web, without having to sign in again. For example, for users that work remotely or from untrusted locations, you might want to limit the time that they can access sensitive resources by applying a shorter web session length. If users want to continue accessing a resource when a session ends, theyâ€™re prompted to sign in again and start a new session.

How the settings work on mobile devices varies by device and app.

## Remediation

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select `Security`.
3. Select `Access and Data Control`.
4. Select `Google session control`.
5. Set `Web session duration` to `12 hours` or less.

## Overview

The CIS Google Workspace Community does not have any specific security recommendations with regard to Google Meet, due to its usage being very organizationally specific.

That being said, are some items that Admins should consider when deploying Google Meet:

- Who should be allowed to create meetings?
 - Example: In an education environment possibly configure that only Teachers can be allowed to create a meeting and Students only attend.
- Who can join a meeting?
 - Example: In an education environment possibly Teachers can attend any meeting (internally or externally created) and Students can only attend internally created meetings.

Settings you may want to review are:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select `Google Workspace`.
3. Select `Apps`.
4. Select `Google Meet`.

5. Select `Meet video settings`.
 - Select `Recording`- `Let people record their meetings.`
 - Select `Stream`- `Let people stream their meetings.`

6. Select `Meet safety settings`.
 - Select `Domain`- `Who can join meetings created by your organization`
 - Select `Access`- `Which meetings users in the organization can join`
 - Select `Joining`- `How users join a meeting (quick access)`
 - Select `Chat`- `Who can send in-call chat messages`
 - Select `Present`- `Who can share their screens in calls`
 - Select `Host management`- `Default host management

**NOTE:**
To configure this properly will likely require creating different Organizational Units (OUs) to segment users properly and allow different configuration settings to be applied. An informative video on this topic can be found **[here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2b3liYvyOTw)**.

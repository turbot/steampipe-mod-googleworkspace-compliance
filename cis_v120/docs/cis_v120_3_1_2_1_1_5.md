## Description

When a user shares a file via a Google product other than Docs or Drive (e.g. by pasting a link in Gmail), Google can check that the recipients have access. If not, when possible, Google will ask the user to pick how they want to share the file.

In general, access should be restricted to the smallest group possible. In this case recipients only.

## Remediation

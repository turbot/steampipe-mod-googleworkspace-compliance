# 1.1.1 Ensure more than one Super Admin account exists

## Description

This control ensures that multiple Super Admin accounts exist in your Google Workspace organization. Having multiple Super Admin accounts is essential for maintaining access to administrative functions in case one account becomes unavailable.

## Rationale

Super Admin accounts have the highest level of privileges in Google Workspace. If only one Super Admin account exists and it becomes compromised or inaccessible (e.g., the administrator leaves the organization or forgets their credentials), it could result in a loss of administrative control over the Google Workspace environment.

## Impact

- **Security**: Medium
- **Implementation**: Easy
- **Operational Impact**: Low

## Audit Procedure

1. Sign in to the Google Admin Console
2. Go to Directory > Users
3. Review the list of users with Super Admin privileges
4. Verify that at least two separate accounts have Super Admin role assigned

## Remediation

To create additional Super Admin accounts:

1. Sign in to the Google Admin Console
2. Go to Directory > Users
3. Select an appropriate user
4. Click "Admin roles and privileges"
5. Assign the Super Admin role
6. Click "Save"

## Default Value

By default, only the initial administrator account has Super Admin privileges.

## Note

While having multiple Super Admin accounts is important, limit the number to minimize potential security risks. Consider using dedicated accounts for Super Admin duties rather than regular user accounts with elevated privileges.

## Description

Having more than one Super Admin account is needed primarily so that a single point of failure can be avoided. Also, for larger organizations, having multiple Super Admins can be useful for workload balancing purposes.

From a security point of view, having only a single Super Admin Account can be problematic if this user were unavailable for an extended period of time. Also, Super Admin accounts should never be shared amongst multiple users.

## Remediation

Create at least one additional account with a Super Admin role.

**NOTE:** A new account should be created vs adding this role to an existing account since Administration tasks should be done through separate Admin accounts.

### Default Value

All Google Workspace tenants will have one Super Admin initially.

## Description

Enable access to Google Workspace APIs for customer-owned / developed applications.

All organization-built internal apps (owned by your organization), can be trusted to access restricted Google Workspace APIs. That way, the organization does not have to trust them all individually.

## Remediation

To configure this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select `Security`.
3. Select `Access and Data Control`.
4. Select `API Controls`, then select `App access control`.
5. Under `Settings`, select `Trust internal, domain-owned apps`.
6. Select `Save`.

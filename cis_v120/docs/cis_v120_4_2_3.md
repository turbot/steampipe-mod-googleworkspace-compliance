## Overview

Google Workspace has extensive Data Leak Protection (DLP) capabilities built in based on the licensing level. These capabilities allow admins to confidently secure your company's sensitive data from being leaked to unauthorized parties and manage third-party app access to your Google Services. CIS considers using these capabilities extremely important, but they are also extremely organization dependent. What is considered protected information varies significantly from company to company and region to region.

For example, Google provides a wide variety of detectors organized by type (Credentials and Secrets, Documents, etc.) and region (United States, United Kingdom, Australia, etc.) For the United States alone here are some options for detectors:

- Social Security Number (SSN)
- Driver's License Number
- Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) Number
- American Bankers Association (ABA) Routing Number
- National Provider Identifier (NPI)
- Committee on Uniform Security Identification Procedures (CUSIP)
- Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Approved Prescription Drugs
- Passport
- State Names
- Adoption Taxpayer Identification Number (ATIN)
- Employer Identification Number (EIN)
- Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)
- Toll Free Phone Number
- Vehicle Identification Number (VIN)
- Preparer Taxpayer Identification Number (PTIN)

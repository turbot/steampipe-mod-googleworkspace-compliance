## Description

By default turn off Google Sites for all users.

There is really no reason for every user within an organization to have access to Google Sites. If this capability is needed, it can be enabled and configured for those users and groups by exception as required by the organization to meet specific needs.

## Remediation

To configure this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select `Apps`.
3. Select `Google Workspace`.
4. Select `Sites`.
5. Select `Service status`.
6. Set `Service status` to `OFF for everyone`.
7. Select `Save`.

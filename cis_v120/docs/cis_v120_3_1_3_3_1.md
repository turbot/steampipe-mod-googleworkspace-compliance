## Description

Quarantines can help prevent spam, minimize data loss, and protect confidential information. They can also help moderate message attachments so users don’t send, open, or click something they shouldn’t.

Admins should be notified periodically when messages are quarantined so they can take the appropriate actions.

## Remediation

To configure this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select `Apps`.
3. Select `Google Workspace`.
4. Select `Gmail`.
5. Under `Manage quarantines`, set `Notify periodically when messages are quarantined` to `checked`.

_As required, give appropriate users the `Access Admin Quarantine` and\or `Access restricted quarantine` roles_

## Description

This option allows non-Super Admin users to recover access to their accounts if their password has been forgotten.

The option is not available if either _Single Sign On_ or _Password Sync_ is in use.

Allowing users to recover access to their accounts when they have forgotten their passwords reduces the number of support tickets generated by users, and reduces the amount of down time spent waiting on the account recovery process to initiate and complete.

## Remediation

To configure this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select `Security`.
3. Select `User account recovery`.
4. Select either the pencil icon or the setting itself.
5. Set `Allow users and non-super admins to recover their account` to checked.
5. Select `Save`.

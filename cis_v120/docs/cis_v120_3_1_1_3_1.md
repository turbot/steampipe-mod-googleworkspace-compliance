## Description

Limit who is allowed offline calendar access.

When enabled, users can turn on offline use for each computer they use. Data is stored on the computer until offline use is turned off by the user. In this case, the organization can lose control of where its data is stored (for this user). Care should be taken regarding which users and groups have this capability enabled.

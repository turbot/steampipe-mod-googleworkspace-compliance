## Description

Enforce 2-Step Verification (Multi-Factor Authentication) for all users.

Add an extra layer of security to users accounts by asking users to verify their identity when they enter a username and password. 2-Step Verification (Multi-factor authentication) requires an individual to present a minimum of two separate forms of authentication before access is granted. 2-Step Verification provides additional assurance that the individual attempting to gain access is who they claim to be. With 2-Step Verification, an attacker would need to compromise at least two different authentication mechanisms, increasing the difficulty of compromise and thus reducing the risk.

# Security

## Overview

This section covers security recommendations for Google Workspace security settings. These controls help ensure that your Google Workspace environment is configured with appropriate security measures.

## Recommendations

### 4.1 Authentication
Controls in this section focus on authentication security:
- Two-factor authentication (2SV) enforcement
- Password policies
- Account recovery settings
- Login challenges
- Security key enforcement

### 4.2 Access and Data Control
Controls in this section focus on access control and data protection:
- Data Loss Prevention (DLP) policies
- Session control settings
- Geographic location restrictions
- API access controls
- Third-party application access

## Implementation

Each control in this section is implemented using SQL queries against the Steampipe Google Workspace plugin tables. The queries check various aspects of security configuration and return one of the following status values:

- `ok` - The control check passed
- `alarm` - The control check failed
- `info` - The control check found something that should be reviewed
- `skip` - The control check was skipped

## Best Practices

1. **Authentication**
   - Enable 2-Step Verification for all users, especially administrators
   - Implement strong password policies
   - Use security keys for high-risk users
   - Enable login challenges for suspicious activity

2. **Access Control**
   - Implement least privilege access
   - Regularly review third-party access
   - Configure geographic access restrictions
   - Monitor and audit access patterns

3. **Data Protection**
   - Configure DLP policies for sensitive data
   - Set appropriate session timeouts
   - Monitor data sharing and access
   - Regularly review security settings

4. **Security Monitoring**
   - Enable comprehensive audit logging
   - Monitor for suspicious activities
   - Review security reports regularly
   - Implement incident response procedures

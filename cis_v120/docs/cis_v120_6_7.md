## Description

Configuring and enabling the setting that an alert will be generated when Google detects compromised credentials requiring a reset of a user's password.

Ensuring that administrators are alerted when Google detects that a user's credentials have been compromised due to a publicized breach. This is usually because the user has reused their credentials at another site that was breached.

## Remediation

To verify this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select `Rules`.
3. Under `Google protects you by default` select `View list`.
4. Scroll to `Leaked password` and select it.
5. Within the `Actions` pane, click the edit pencil on the right side of the pane.
6. Select `Send to alert center` (This will result in the alert being set to On).
7. Set the alert severity to `High`.
8. To enable emails when this alert condition is met, select `Send email notifications`. Once enabled, the `All super administrators` option is selected by default.
9. Click `Review` to confirm the values.
10. Click `Update Rule`.
11. Confirm that the `Leaked password` shows an Alert status of `On` in the list.

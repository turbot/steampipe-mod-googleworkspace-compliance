## Overview

The Reporting section of the Google Workspace Admin Console.

This area is quite diverse and there is a wide variety of existing reports available and even more, that can be developed by users. The usefulness of these reports are very organizationally specific and CIS urges companies to explore the various reporting capabilities and tailor them to the organization's needs.

This section will cover a few specific security-related reports that CIS feels are applicable to all organizations and that should be reviewed on a regular basis.

**NOTE:** Some of the reports will ultimately go to other sections of the UI and these same reports can be accessed there. The "Reports" section just is just a way to consolidate them into one area of the Google Workspace admin UI.

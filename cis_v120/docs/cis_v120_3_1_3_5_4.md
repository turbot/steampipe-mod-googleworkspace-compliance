## Description

Gmail adds an image or colored border to external addresses.

As an admin for your organization, you can turn alerts on or off for messages that include external recipients (people with email addresses outside of your organization). These alerts help people avoid unintentional replies, and remind them to treat external messages with caution.

## Remediation

**To configure external recipient warnings are enabled, use the Google Workspace Admin Console:**

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select `Apps`.
3. Select `Google Workspace`.
4. Select `Gmail`.
5. Select `End User Access`.
6. Select `Warn for external recipients`.
7. Set `Highlight any external recipients in a conversation. Warn users before they reply to email with external recipients who aren't in their contacts.` to `checked`.
8. Select `Save`.

## Description

Comprehensive mail storage ensures messages sent by other core services appear in users' sent folders and are therefore accessible to Vault.

As an administrator, you can ensure that a copy of all sent or received messages in your domain—including messages sent or received by non-Gmail mailboxes—is stored in the associated users' Gmail mailboxes.

## Remediation

8. Select `Save`.

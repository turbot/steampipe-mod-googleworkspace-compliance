## Overview

The Rules section of the UI.

**Note on the Rules section**

Google Workspace has a powerful notification capability consolidated in the Rules section of the admin UI. A given organization may want to define a wide variety of rules to notify key people of various security-related events. This section will provide some specific recommendations that CIS feels that should be monitored universally, but it only scratches the surface of possibilities. Admins are encouraged to learn more about how to define new rules specific to their organization's needs and threats and use them to their advantage.

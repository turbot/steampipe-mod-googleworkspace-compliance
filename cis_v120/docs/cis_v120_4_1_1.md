# 4.1.1 Ensure 2-Step Verification is enforced for all users in administrative roles

## Description

This control ensures that all users with administrative roles have 2-Step Verification (2SV) enabled. Two-factor authentication provides an additional layer of security beyond passwords.

## Rationale

Administrative accounts have elevated privileges and access to sensitive data and settings. Compromising an administrative account could lead to a full compromise of your Google Workspace environment. Enforcing 2-Step Verification helps prevent unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.

## Impact

- **Security**: High
- **Implementation**: Easy
- **Operational Impact**: Low

## Audit Procedure

1. Sign in to the Google Admin Console
2. Go to Security > 2-Step Verification
3. Review the 2-Step Verification enforcement settings for admin users
4. Verify that 2-Step Verification is enforced for all administrative roles

## Remediation

To enforce 2-Step Verification for administrative users:

1. Sign in to the Google Admin Console
2. Go to Security > 2-Step Verification
3. Click "Edit" for the enforcement settings
4. Enable "Enforce 2-Step Verification for admin users"
5. Click "Save"

## Default Value

By default, 2-Step Verification is not enforced for administrative users.

## Note

Consider using security keys as the second factor for administrative accounts, as they provide stronger protection against phishing attacks compared to other 2SV methods.

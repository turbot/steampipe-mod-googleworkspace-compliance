Details on what each of these fields mean can be found **[here](https://apps.google.com/supportwidget/articlehome?hl=en&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.google.com%2Fa%2Fanswer%2F4579578%3Fhl%3Den&assistant_id=generic-unu&product_context=4579578&product_name=UnuFlow&trigger_context=a)**. This report should be reviewed weekly.

**NOTE:** In larger organizations reviewing this entire report weekly may not be possible. At a minimum, all Administrator and Super Administrator users should be reviewed, since they are a higher risk. These can be filtered from the overall user list.

The App usage report can allow administrator to discover user that are potentially using application that they do not have access to and/or using in atypical ways.

## Remediation

The remediation for any anomalies in the various fields varies widely (different sections of the Google Workspace Admin UI). Please refer to Google's documentation for specifics (**[here](https://apps.google.com/supportwidget/articlehome?hl=en&article_url=https%3A%2F%2Fsupport.google.com%2Fa%2Fanswer%2F4579578%3Fhl%3Den&assistant_id=generic-unu&product_context=4579578&product_name=UnuFlow&trigger_context=a)**).

**NOTE:** Many of these settings will be remedied by implementing other sections of this Benchmark. For example, an Admin showing recent Gmail (IMAP) - last used time and/or Gmail (POP) - last used time can be remedied by implementing the Remediation procedure for the recommendation **Ensure POP and IMAP access is disabled for all users**.

## Default Value

The report will display all users and fields.

## Description

The default is that Gmail always tries to send messages over a secure TLS connection. If the receiving server doesn't use TLS, Gmail still sends messages with TLS but the connection isn't secure.

This setting allows the option to require a CA-signed certificate, verify the hostname associated with the certificate, and test the TLS connection.

A padlock image will appear next to the recipient address if the message will be sent with TLS. The padlock shows only for accounts with a Google Workspace subscription that supports S/MIME encryption.

Google Workspace supports TLS versions 1.0, 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) encrypts email messages for security and privacy and prevents unauthorized access of messages when they're sent over internet connections.

## Remediation

To configure this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select `Apps`.
3. Select `Google Workspace`.
4. Select `Gmail`.
5. Select `Compliance`.
6. Select `Secure transport (TLS) compliance`.
7. Select `Configure`.
7. Set `Inbound - all messages` and `Outbound - all messages` to `checked `.
8. Select `Save`.

**Note:** Enabling the `Inbound - all messages` and `Outbound - all messages` configurations will also, by default, enable `Require CA-signed certificate when delivering outbound messages to the TLS-enabled domains specified above`. This is not a required configuration, but it is recommended.

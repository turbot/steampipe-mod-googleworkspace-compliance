## Description

Configure Google Workspace security settings to prevent access to less secure apps.

You can block sign-in attempts from some apps or devices that are less secure. Apps that are less secure don't use modern security standards, such as OAuth. Using apps and devices that donâ€™t use modern security standards increases the risk of accounts being compromised. Blocking these apps and devices helps keep your users and data safe.

## Remediation

2. Select `Security`.
3. Select `Access and Data Control`.

5. Select `Disable access to less secure apps (Recommended)`.
6. Click `Save` to commit this configuration change.

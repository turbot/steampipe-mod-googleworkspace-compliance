## Description

Prevent unrestricted application access to Google services.

You can restrict (or leave unrestricted) access to most Workspace services, including Google Cloud Platform services such as Machine Learning. For Gmail and Google Drive, you can specifically restrict access to high-risk scopes (for example, sending Gmail or deleting files in Drive). While users are prompted to consent to apps, if an app uses restricted scopes and you haven’t specifically trusted it, users can’t add it.

## Remediation

To configure this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select `Security`.
3. Select `Access and Data Control`.
4. Select `API Controls`, then select `App access control`.
5. Under `Overview`, select `MANAGE GOOGLE SERVICES`.
6. Select `ALL` applicable Google Services.
7. Click `Change access`.
8. Select `Restricted: Only trusted apps can access a service`.

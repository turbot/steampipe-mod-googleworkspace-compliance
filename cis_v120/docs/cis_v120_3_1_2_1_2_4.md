## Description

limit what viewers/commenters on a shared document can do with it.

In many cases when sharing a document it might be fine for the users to do what they want with the document on the shared drive (Download, Print, etc.). In more restricted environments these capabilities may need to be prevented (Protected Intellectual property, Personally Identifiable Information, etc.).

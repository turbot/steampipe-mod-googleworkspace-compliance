## Description

Control whether users in your organization can access external groups from their Google Workspace account. External groups are created outside your organization and might include a public community group or a group for a club a user belongs to.

Control access to external groups by turning on or off the Google Groups additional service â€” a legacy service in your Admin console that does only one thing: It allows or blocks users from accessing external groups from their Google Workspace account.

**NOTE:** This service has no effect on your organization's internal groups.

In general, most of the organization's personnel do not need to assess external groups. They can be allowed by exception as needed by the business.

## Remediation

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select `Apps`.
3. Select `Google Workspace`.
4. Select `Additional Google services.
5. Scroll down to `Google Groups`.
6. Set it to `OFF for everyone`.

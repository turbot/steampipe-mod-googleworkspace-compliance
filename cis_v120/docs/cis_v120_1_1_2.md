## Description

Having more than one Super Admin account is needed primarily so that a single point of failure can be avoided, but having too many should be avoided.

From a security point of view, having a large number of Super Admin accounts is a bad practice. In general, all users should be assigned the least privileges needed to do their job. This includes Administrators since not everyone that needs to "Administer Something" needs to be a Super Admin. Google Workspaces provides many predefined Administration Roles and also allows the creation of Custom Roles with very granular permission selection.

## Remediation

Reduce the number of accounts with a "Super Admin" role.

### Default Value

All Google Workspace tenants will have one Super Admin initially.

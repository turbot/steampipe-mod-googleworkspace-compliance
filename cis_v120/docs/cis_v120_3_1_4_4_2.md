## Description

Allow users to configure incoming webhooks and developers to call incoming webhooks to post content. Incoming webhooks let you send asynchronous messages into Google Chat from applications that aren't Chat apps.

Webhook usage should be carefully controlled (vetted and approved) since a malicious application could send bogus information to exposed webhooks and ultimately these users.

## Remediation

To configure this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select `Apps`.
3. Select `Google Chat and classic Hangouts`.
4. Select `Chat apps`.
5. Under `Chat apps access settings`, set `Allow users to add and use incoming webhooks` to `OFF`.

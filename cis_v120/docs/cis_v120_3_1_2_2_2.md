## Description

Prevent documents from being locally accessible on an unconnected device.

This setting prevents an organization's files from being stored locally, thus limiting data loss issues if the device is lost or stolen.

**NOTE:** The Google Drive desktop application has its own way of handling "Offline" files and does not obey the `Drive and Doc` > `Offline` > `Control offline access using divide policies` setting. Not allowing Google Drive for desktop on the device will prevent this channel.

## Remediation

To verify this setting via the Google Workspace Admin Console:

1. Log in to `https://admin.google.com` as an administrator.
2. Select `Apps`.
3. Select `Google Workspace`.
4. Select `Drive and Docs`.
5. Select `Features and Applications`.
6. Select `Google Drive for desktop`.
7. Set `Allow Google Drive for desktop in your organization` to `unchecked`.
8. Select `Save`.
